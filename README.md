## Project Idea

The idea behind TimeTubeTracker stemmed from the need for a tool that could efficiently analyze YouTube playlists and provide detailed metrics. With the exponential growth of online content, especially on platforms like YouTube, users often find it challenging to manage and understand the content within their playlists. TimeTubeTracker aims to simplify this process by offering essential insights into playlist durations and some video statistics.

- Calculate total number of videos in a playlist
- Calculate average video duration
- Calculate total playlist duration at different playback speeds (1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, and 2x)
- Specify a range to calculate playlist duration
- User authentication system (optional login)
- Save favorite playlists for easy access
- Analyze multiple playlists and get the combined duration
